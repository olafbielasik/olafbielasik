## 🔨 Projects

### [WingFlowLES - CFD Simulation](https://github.com/olafbielasik/WingFlowLES)  
**LES Simulation of Turbulent Flow over a Clark Y Airfoil**  
- Simulates turbulent flow over a Clark Y airfoil at a -20° angle using a 600x400 stretched grid, 60.000 steps, Smagorinsky model, and IB method
- Visualizes lift and vorticity in a **4K, 120 FPS animation** using Matplotlib, FFmpeg, Flowframes and Video2X
- Performs **9.67 trillion operations** with HPC optimization using Numba

### [Starlink Tracker](https://github.com/olafbielasik/StarlinkTracker)  
**Real-time rendering of Starlink satellite positions, based on real-time TLE data**
- Earth globe with zoom & rotate (mouse-controlled)
- Tooltip showing satellite name and coordinates

### [GravityRouge - 2D Game](https://github.com/olafbielasik/GravityRouge)  
**A 2D space game developed in Unity, in which you move among asteroids in a weightless state, using a jetpack and a rope to survive** 
- This project was created as a Unity 2D gameplay showcase
- It features fully custom physics, procedural generation, grappling mechanics, jetpack fuel logic, and UI systems - built entirely from scratch
