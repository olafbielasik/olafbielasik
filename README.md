### [ActiveSatellitesTracker](https://github.com/olafbielasik/ActiveSatellitesTracker)  
**2D PyGame Tool to Visualize Active Satellites 🛰**  
- Visualizes active satellites in orbit using real-time TLE data and skyfield.
- Features interactive zoom, pan, and 3D-like Earth rendering.

### [HandwrittenDigitRecognizer](https://github.com/olafbielasik/HandwrittenDigitRecognizer)  
**Simple Handwritten Digit Recognizer built with PyTorch and Flask ✍️**
- It trains a neural network on the MNIST dataset and deploys it as a web application where users can draw digits on a canvas and receive real-time predictions, you can also upload your own pictures.

### [GravityRouge - 2D Game](https://github.com/olafbielasik/GravityRouge)  
**A 2D space game developed in Unity, in which you move among asteroids in a weightless state, using a jetpack and a rope to survive 🎮** 
- This project was created as a Unity 2D gameplay showcase.
- It features fully custom physics, procedural generation, grappling mechanics, jetpack fuel logic, and UI systems - built entirely from scratch.

### [UAVSharks - web store](https://github.com/olafbielasik/UAVSharks)
**This project is a modern, single-page website template for a drone parts store 🌐**
- Features a fixed header for seamless navigation, interactive search with real-time filtering, and a dynamic shopping cart that updates instantly. 
- Includes user account management, responsive product showcases, customer reviews, team profiles, and an FAQ section—all designed to deliver an engaging and efficient e-commerce experience.
